The Huffman coding algorithm is a widely used method for lossless data compression. It assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. The goal is to minimize the total size of the encoded message.

Key Concepts of Huffman Coding:
Frequency-based Encoding: Huffman coding uses the frequency of each character in the input data to build an optimal binary tree (called the Huffman Tree).

Optimality: It minimizes the total number of bits used to represent the data.

Prefix-Free: The codes assigned to each character are such that no code is a prefix of another, ensuring that the codes can be uniquely decoded.

Steps in Huffman Coding:
Calculate Frequency: Calculate the frequency of each character in the data to be encoded.

Build the Huffman Tree:

Treat each character as a node with its frequency.

Build a binary tree by repeatedly merging the two nodes with the lowest frequencies until only one node (the root of the tree) remains.

Assign Codes: Traverse the Huffman tree and assign binary codes (0 or 1) to each character. The more frequent characters get shorter codes, while the less frequent characters get longer codes.

Encode the Data: Replace each character in the original data with its corresponding Huffman code.
